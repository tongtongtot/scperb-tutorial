We are excited to present scPerb, a groundbreaking model utilizing the innovative concept of style-transfer Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to predict single-cell perturbation. Our team consists of Zijia Tang, Professor Qianqian Song, and Zhengyong Hu, working collaboratively to build an accurate model to predict single-cell perturbation.  

Zijia Tang comes from Guangdong Experimental High School, and he is a talented and hard-working student. He started coding in Grade 5 and got a lot of prizes in OI competitions such as NOIP. Now he could use tools such as PyTorch to proficiently build up neural networks. 

Professor Song is the mentor of Zijia Tang, coming from the University of Florida. She has been working on bioinformatics and biomedical informatics for years in areas such as Advanced ML/AI Method Development and Single-cell omics and Multi-omics studies in diseases. Her expertise in single-cell helped a lot. 

Zhengyong Hu is one of the leaders of STEM classes at Guangdong Experimental High School and has been teaching computer science for over 10 years. His rich experience in projects and computer science has played an important role in scPerb. 

Now, our team is going to promote our result to spacial transcriptomics, making scPerb more applicable and promising in the field of bioinformatics and biomedical informatics.
