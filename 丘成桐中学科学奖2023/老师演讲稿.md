I am Zhengyong Hu, one of the mentors of Zijia Tang. Today, I am speaking on behalf of the mentors of Zijia Tang. We are not paid to guide Zijia Tang in writing scPerb, and NO training institution is involved in the whole process of the competition.

I gave Zijia lots of advice when he was stuck and had no idea how to improve the modelâ€™s performance. I suggested he look up papers via Arxiv.com and nature.com and the state-of-the-art applications in generative models. Together we dived into VAEs and GANs and finally found a way to enhance the performance.

Prof. Song is another mentor of Zijia Tang. She is an expert in Bioinformatics. She gave Zijia many suggestions, helped him in the right direction, and taught him a lot of knowledge in Biology and Bioinformatics. She also taught him a lot about how to draw figures, and how to write manuscripts academically. They went over how to choose the word to clarify a sentence, how to polish the figures and manuscripts, and how to insert references correctly.
